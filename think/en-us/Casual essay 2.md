When I do a math problem, I often think like this:  
Let's start with a general direction. Then slowly think in that direction concretely.  
These two processes I think use two kinds of thinking, first using intuition and then using reasoning  
Intuition itself is a big mapper.  
The reasoning process is more like building blocks using multiple little mappers.  
The current large model feels like training intuition, there seems to be a problem in the direction, when we reason, we often do not need so large mapping machines, these large mapping machines need a lot of data to train, many times may not be necessary.  
Moreover, the mapping relationship established in this large mapping machine may be wrong, and the small mapping machine is relatively easier to correct.
